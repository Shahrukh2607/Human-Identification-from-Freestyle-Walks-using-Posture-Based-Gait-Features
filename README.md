# Human-Identification-from-Freestyle-Walks-using-Posture-Based-Gait-Features
This project is a real-time human identification system using posture-based gait features from freestyle walking. Combines computer vision and machine learning (Extra Trees, KNN, MLP) for accurate recognition in uncontrolled environments. Built with Python and OpenCV.
